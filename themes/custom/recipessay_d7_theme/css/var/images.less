/* 

Include images in the image folder and then put the filename here, then call them inline with background-image(@var)

Example:

in images.less

@image-sample: 'example.png';

in style.less

.selector {
  @background-image(@image-sample);
}

Why do we do this? to decouple Adobe from our stylesheets of course! we can rename, replace and remove images painlessly.
This will save you from the pain of asking a designer to re-export/slice a bunch of images out of photoshop for some reason 
(maybe they had the wrong colour profile) and they all come back with completely different names so you now need to pick
through your 5000 line stylesheet to inject them all back in one-by-one... It also means that somebody other than you
can update the images in the site by updating where the variables point.
